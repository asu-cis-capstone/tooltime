#Getting started with ToolTime

##Suggested Software
* phpMyAdmin (managing MySQL server)
* WAMP (local server host and testing)
* FTP client (transfer files to web domain)
* Git Bash (manage repository)
* Notepad++ (edit files)

##Implementing
1. Obtain domain hosting with MySQL server (we use GoDaddy)
2. Run SQL scripts (to come) to establish database
3. Drop all files from public_html into your site's root directory
