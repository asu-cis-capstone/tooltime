#Its Tool Time!

##Overview
Tool Time (*working title*) will be a mobile tool used by construction professionals to manage and track internal tool rental. It will consist of a mobile app (initially iOS) that will be used by Bayley Construction employees to rent and return tools from the company's warehouse. Additionally, a webpage will be accessible to the project manager to view the status of tools, individual rental histories of employees, add tools, remove tools, etc.
