			Bayley Construction was established in Mercer Island, Washington in 1963. Since then, 
			their work in commerical construction has expanded throughout the west coast and across the US. 
			They currently have offices in Arizona, California and Washington. Bayley is constantly seeking to 
			improve their internal business practices and has sought our team to develop an efficient, user-friendly 
			way to manage their existing tool rental system. Internally, Bayley rents tools to employees from their 
			warehouses and currently has no way of managing these rentals. They would like our team to develop a 
			system that will allow employees to rent and return tools by scanning barcodes, create reports based on 
			rental history, and manage tool inventory.
